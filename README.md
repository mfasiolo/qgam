# **qgam**: quantile GAMs

This R package offers methods for fitting additive quantile regression models based on splines, using the methods described in [Fasiolo et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03307).

See the [vignette](https://mfasiolo.github.io/qgam/articles/qgam.html) for an introduction to the most important functions:

- `qgam` fits an additive quantile regression model to a single quantile. Very similar to `mgcv::gam`. It returns an `mgcv::gamObject`.
- `mqgam` fits the same additive quantile regression model to several quantiles. It is more efficient that calling `qgam` several time, 
          especially in terms of memory.
- `tuneLearn` useful for tuning the learning rate of the Gibbs posterior. It evaluates a calibration loss function on a grid of values 
              provided by the user. 
- `tuneLearnFast` similar to `tuneLearn`, but here the learning rate is selected by minimizing the calibration loss using Brent method.
